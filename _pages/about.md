<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.

<p style="text-align:justify">
I'm currently a student in 9th semester of the Physics Engineering career at Faculty of Physical-Mathematical Sciences of the Universidad Autónoma de Coahuila. At the moment I'm working in my thesis about quantum geometry in 2D materials under the guidance of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pierre-Pantaleon">PhD. Pierre Anthony Pantaleón</a>. 
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
My research interests focus on the application of geometry and topology in physics. In particular my main area of interest is the mathematical physics of topological quantum matter. I have strong programming skills in Python and C/C++. I keep on learning continuously and I like to share with others what I have learnt.
</p>

<!--However, another area of interest and in which I have a bit more experience is scientific computing (numerical analysis, in particular the computational physics).-->

Feel free to contact me at my email [lsgm16308@gmail.com](mailto:lsgm16308@gmail.com) or [luis-sanchez@uadec.edu.mx](mailto:luis-sanchez@uadec.edu.mx). 

## About website

<p style="text-align:justify">
The website is not entirely in English, some posts will be in Spanish, depending on the target audience. Posts in Spanish will be tag (SPA). In the future, I hope to separate the website into two, one in English and one in Spanish.
