<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

My research interests focus on theoretical electronic, optical and topological properties of two-dimensional systems, as well as strongly correlated phenomena. However, I am also interested in mathematical physics, in particular in the application of geometry and topology in physics. In addition, I have strong programming skills in Python and C/C++. I am continuously learning and I like to share with others what I have learned.<br><br>
<b>Disciplines:</b> Condensed Matter Physics, Theoretical Physics <br>
<b>Skills:</b> Quantum Mechanics, Graphene, Dirac materials, Topological Insulators, Group Theory, Topology, Python.

### about website

<p style="text-align:justify">
This page was created using a <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> template for academic website.  For more information, please refer to the following link: <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">al-folio</a>. <br><br>
The website is not entirely in English. Some posts will be in Spanish, depending on the target audience. Posts in Spanish will be tagged: (ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½). In the future, the idea is to separate the website into  English and Spanish version.
