<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.

I’m master's student in Prof. Ramón Carrillo-Bastos’s theory group, part of the <b>Quantum Transport and Optical Phenomena</b> Research Group at the Faculty of Science, UABC.<br><br>

My research focuses on theoretical condensed matter physics, particularly on the electronic, optical, and topological properties of two-dimensional quantum materials. I combine analytical and numerical techniques to study systems such as graphene, Dirac materials and topological insulators. <br><br>

Alongside my academic work, I have strong technical skills in Python and C/C++, with experience in scientific computing and data analysis. I'm constantly learning new tools and enjoy sharing knowledge through teaching, mentoring, and science communication.<br><br>

I'm currently preparing for a PhD in physics and also developing skills relevant to data science and AI, aiming to contribute in academia and industry.<br><br>

🔬 Theoretical Physics · 🧑‍🏫 Teaching · 📢 Outreach · 💻 Scientific Programming · 📈 Data Science

<b>Disciplines:</b> Condensed Matter Physics, Theoretical Physics <br>
<b>Skills:</b> Quantum Mechanics, Graphene, Dirac materials, Topological Insulators, Group Theory, Topology, Python.
