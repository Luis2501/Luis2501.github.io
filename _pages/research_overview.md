My research interests focus on theoretical condensed matter physics, with a particular emphasis on theoretical and numerical exploration of the electronic, optical and topological properties of two-dimensional systems. <br><br>

In addition to our work with Prof. Carrillo's group, we collaborate with various prestigious groups, including the Department of Physics at the Center for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (UNAM), the Department of Complex Systems at the Institute of Physics (UNAM), and the Theoretical Modeling Group at IMDEA Nanoscience.

In concrect, I was work with novel materials called quantum materials, which exhibits novel electronic and transport properties. One of the most . For example,  a systems based in a honeycomb lattice.
